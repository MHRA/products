# API rust server

This is where the API rust server lives.

## Prerequisites

You should have `rust` installed, ideally `rustup`.
If you're using homebrew, you should be able to install `rustup` by running:

1. `brew install rustup-init`
2. `rustup-init` and following the instructions

You may be able to install `rustup` through your chosen package manager, if you use one.

Otherwise, visit [rust-lang's `rustup` installation guide][rustup install], which has instructions for your operating system.
For installing

You should also have installed:

- [Docker][docker install]
- [Kubernetes `kubectl`][kubernetes install] to manage the Kubernetes cluster.
- [Kubernetes `stern`][stern]

## Running locally ü¶Ä

1. Navigate to this directory, `/medicines/api`
2. Run `cargo run`
3. Once compiled, open a browser tab and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz
4. You should see **OK** rendered on the page

To see the graphql explorer, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphiql.

## Running in Docker container üê≥

1. Navigate to this directory, `/medicines/api`
2. Run `docker-compose build`
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/healthz`
5. You should see an **Ok** and a server log in your terminal

To see the graphql explorer, go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/graphiql.

## Deploy API pod in Kuberbetes cluster ‚éà

1. Navigate to this directory, `/medicines/api`
2. Create [Kubernetes Service][kubernetes service]

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./infrastructure/non-prod/service.yml
   ```

3. Deploy [Kubernetes pod][kubernetes pod] by applying a deployment

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./infrastructure/non-prod/deployment.yml
   ```

4. Check if the pods are running

   ```sh
   stern api
   ```

5. You should receive a health server log like this

   ```sh
   api-558646c969-9mdxp api [2020-01-20T15:02:57Z INFO  actix_web::middleware::logger] 10.244.1.1:51524 "GET /healthz HTTP/1.1" 200 2 "-" "kube-probe/1.14" 0.000059
   ```

## Deploy API pod in Kuberbetes cluster via CI/CD pipeline

We are using a [secondary pipeline](./azure-pipeline.yml) instead of the [main pipeline](../../azure-pipelines.yml) because we have created a new development environment that enables us to create and test kubernetes features.

This pipeline is triggered when the following conditions are true:

- a new commit is made on `master` branch
- the commit made changes in this file path `medicines/api/*`
