# Destroy and provision Kubernetes cluster for development

To reduce development cost, every weekday night we destroy the kubernetes cluster and provision it again the next morning.

The following instructions are divided into:

- [Destroy cluster](#destroy-cluster)
- [Provision cluster](#provision-cluster)

## Requirements

You should have installed the following tools

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/)

## Setting up

Before either destroying or provisioning a kubernetes cluster, take these setup steps.

1. Change to the relevant environment directory (e.g. `infrastructure/environments/non-prod`)
2. Source the environment variables

   ```sh
     set -a && source .env && set +a
   ```

3. Initialize terraform (ensure providers/modules are installed and backend is initialized)

   ```sh
     terraform init
   ```

## Destroy cluster ðŸ’£

First, follow the [setup steps above](#setting-up).

Destroying the cluster is now just one step:

```sh
  terraform destroy --target=module.cluster.azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.cluster
```

This should give a nice message saying well done on a good destruction job: `Destruction complete.`

## Provision cluster âŽˆ

First, follow the [setup steps above](#setting-up).

1. Provision cluster.

   ```sh
   terraform apply --target=module.cluster.azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.cluster
   ```

2. Update your `~/.kube/config` with credentials for the new cluster, by running this script.

   ```sh
   ../../scripts/create-kubernetes-config.sh
   ```

3. Install Istio, Sealed Secrets and ArgoCD (https://github.com/MHRA/deployments)

The cluster is now ready.

### Deploying services

We are storing the configuration (manifests) for all the services in the cluster in the deployments repo (https://github.com/MHRA/deployments) so that they are provisioned using GitOps by ArgoCD.
